# Development setup

The supported development check currently targets Linux x86_64 with Python 3.12.
It exercises the video, inference and window dependencies; it does not launch a
Framejacker application or connect to a camera.

## Install and run

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) using its
documented instructions. Setup was tested with uv 0.12.23. From the repository:

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/smoke_check.py
```

The setup script resolves its working directory from its own location, creates
`.venv` with Python 3.12, synchronizes the pinned development packages, checks
dependency compatibility, and downloads the three smoke-test fixtures. Running
setup again reuses the environment and verifies cached fixture checksums. The
dedicated `.venv` is managed by this script; dependency synchronization removes
packages absent from `requirements-dev.txt`.

The first run needs PyPI package downloads and
`raw.githubusercontent.com` for the model/image fixtures. If uv needs to obtain
Python, its managed-Python download also needs GitHub release access. No API keys
are required for the current checks.

Setup uses normal TLS verification. The fixture downloader verifies SHA-256
against `scripts/smoke-assets.json` before making a download available. An
existing cached fixture with a different checksum causes an error. Inspect and
remove that specific generated file before downloading it again; do not change
the expected checksum just to make the check pass.

## What validation demonstrates

The smoke check generates an MJPEG video from 12 copies of the upstream sample
image, reads all 12 frames with OpenCV's FFmpeg backend, runs MobileNet-SSD on CPU,
and requires bicycle, car and dog detections on each frame. Qt renders the
annotations and writes a nonblank screenshot. A separate bundled ONNX
multiplication graph executes with checked numerical output.

It invalidates the previous `artifacts/smoke/readiness.json` before importing
runtime dependencies and writes a new report only after success. The detector
fixture is a development check, not a selected production model.

| Path | Contents | Committed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.venv/` | Dedicated Python environment | No |
| `.cache/uv/` | Default package cache | No |
| `.cache/framejacker/assets/` | Verified model, model configuration and sample image | No |
| `artifacts/smoke/readiness.json` | Current passing validation report | No |
| `artifacts/smoke/detection-window.png` | Rendered detection result | No |
| `artifacts/smoke/sample.avi` | Generated repeated-image MJPEG video | No |
| `scripts/smoke-assets.json` | Immutable fixture URLs and SHA-256 checksums | Yes |

Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` or `XDG_CACHE_HOME` before setup to reuse another writable
package/font cache. The fixture directory stays repository-local. The downloader
also accepts `--asset-dir` for isolated download checks; the smoke check uses the
default fixture directory.

## Window rendering and hardware

The default smoke check sets `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` when unset. It shows no
visible desktop UI and exits after checking the frames. Visible presentation
needs a working display server and Qt platform libraries. The interactive
prototype is `scripts/replay_window.py`. OpenCV is installed headless; the
replay app uses Qt for presentation.

OpenCV 4.12 is pinned because the Caffe importer needed by this fixture was
removed from OpenCV 5. The wheel includes its own FFmpeg backend; the current
smoke script does not invoke a separately installed `ffmpeg` executable.

Do not copy an x86_64 virtual environment onto the headset. Device dependencies
and camera/runtime capabilities must be installed and verified for the target
architecture. Live capture, stereo synchronization, depth, tracking-space
alignment, performance and acceleration remain untested here. The user has
confirmed replay video, controls and a VR panel following their head on Frame;
the cloud tests do not exercise a headset runtime.
See the [camera guide](steam-frame-camera.md) and
[implementation milestones](architecture.md).

## Recorded MP4 inspection

`python3 scripts/recording_check.py /path/to/recording.mp4` inspects container
headers without opening a camera, decoding frames, or installing packages. With
no path it selects the latest `*_stereo.mp4` in
`~/Videos/ArcturusVisionCamera`. Stop the recording before inspection. Track
sample-entry codes and dimensions guide decoder selection; successful metadata
inspection does not establish decoding or detection support for that recording.

On the headset, `bash scripts/frame_replay_check.sh` combines this inspection
with `scripts/device_check.py`. It is intentionally read-only and does not
initialize OpenVR.

Run the dependency-free parser checks with
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`. They cover track metadata, malformed
containers, parsing limits, media-payload skipping and nonregular-file rejection.
Decoder integration tests are skipped when PyAV is unavailable.

## File-decoding environment

`bash scripts/setup_replay.sh` creates a separate Python 3.12 `.venv-replay` and
installs the pinned binary wheel in `requirements-replay.txt`. Set
`FRAMEJACKER_PYTHON=/path/to/python3.12` if the default `python3` differs.
This check does not need the full desktop requirements or `uv`.

```bash
.venv-replay/bin/python scripts/replay_decode_check.py /path/to/recording.mp4
.venv-replay/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

PyAV selects the requested video stream and converts a few decoded frames to
RGB without NumPy, OpenCV or Qt. Tests generate real fragmented HEVC with two
different video-track dimensions, exercise both selections, and check failures
for absent streams and invalid/nonregular files. They do not reproduce Arcturus
calibration, metadata payloads, dependent stereo views or HDR color management.

## Annotated replay window

```bash
bash scripts/setup_window.sh
.venv-replay/bin/python scripts/replay_window.py /path/to/recording.mp4
```

Setup extends `.venv-replay` using `requirements-window.txt` and verifies the
existing model/image fixtures. The window runs PyAV and CPU MobileNet-SSD on a
worker thread, keeps one latest annotated result, and presents it on the Qt
thread. The prototype has pause/resume, replay and loop controls. Processing
replay is capped at 10 fps by default and preserves every processed frame's
association with its detections; this is not a real-time source-timing player.

To run a finite, offscreen check with explicit output files:

```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/replay-window
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen .venv-replay/bin/python scripts/replay_window.py \
  /path/to/recording.mp4 --max-frames 4 \
  --preview artifacts/replay-window/preview.png \
  --report artifacts/replay-window/report.json
```

Output paths must be new and distinct from the input recording. Without these
flags the app saves no images or reports; it prints a JSON summary on exit.
Use a new output path for subsequent checks. `--video-stream` selects a video
track; no stereo-side identity is inferred. `--threshold` selects detection
confidence. The demo has 20 classes and is not a selected production detector.
Visible device presentation, orientation, color/HDR, accuracy and performance
are still on-device acceptance work. Linux ARM64 Qt wheels require glibc 2.39+
and graphical-system dependencies; the native X11 path checks `ldd` output for
missing plugin libraries before creating a QApplication.

Run `.venv-replay/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` after window
setup for the complete parser, decoder and offscreen display checks. The window
tests generate two-track replay video and require bicycle/car/dog detections,
a nonblank preview, correct track selection and input-file preservation.

## Continuous integration

The [GitHub Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/checks.yml) runs the same setup
and smoke check on an Ubuntu runner with Python 3.12. It needs network access to
the fixture sources. A file-decoder job installs PyAV and exercises fragmented
HEVC replay and RGB conversion. A separate job builds the native OpenVR probe, verifies that
default and invalid invocations stop before OpenVR initialization, and checks
missing-runtime diagnostics with explicit opt-in. The probe has interrupted
visible passthrough on the tested headset; do not repeat that unchanged hardware
test. CI does not stand in for a headset test. Local execution
of these commands is separate from a successful GitHub Actions run after push.

The replay-window job installs the window requirements and exercises decoding,
inference, Qt offscreen presentation and file-protection behavior end to end.

## Native VR panel build and validation

`bash scripts/build_overlay_bridge.sh` builds the native tool into ignored
`artifacts/overlay-bridge/`, using the pinned SDK in `.cache/openvr`. The camera
and overlay builders share `scripts/build_openvr_tool.sh`; neither builder runs
a runtime test. The camera binary's explicit opt-in guard remains in place.

The overlay job checks strict C++ syntax, packet bounds, malformed input, idle
payload timeouts, signals and named missing-runtime diagnostics. The replay
window job also builds the bridge so its validation-only mode can check actual
RGBA forwarding and Qt control creation. This mode reports no OpenVR
initialization and zero submitted frames. For the real hardware procedure,
read [VR replay panel](vr-overlay.md).
